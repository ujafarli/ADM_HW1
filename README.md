I have created folders which contains tasks according to HackerRank. For example, in the folder "Introduction",there are tasks from HackerRank's Introduction part. I did not write Regex part from HackerRank. Except that, all other 13 parts have been upladed to github. Each script named as same as in HackerRank. In the folder Stamps, you can find my screenshots of submissions.
